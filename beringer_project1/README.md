Convolutional Neural Network Implemented in FPGA

Iteration1:
- This Jupyter Notebook constructs a simple CNN with ONNX
- This model is more simple than we were expecting because we switched to the ONNX API because of its compatability with FINN
- Using Netron the graph is visually displayed
- Input values are randomly generated to be input to the model
- An inference is run and outputs are compared to the expeced outputs, passing with flying colors
- We are excited to experiment with a more complex neural network in the next iteration


Image Resizer:
- Download the ImageRec.py and 2.png file. We've given the 2.png file for convenience but and image file can be used.
- Open the imageRec.py script in an editor and change the path of the image (line 8) to where you have saved the image. (image_path = "yourpath/2.png")
- Save the python script.
- Make sure you have the PLT and matplotlib modules installed.
- Run the python script in python 2.7. In the command prompt run "python imageRec.py" when in the correct directory. 
- Once the script is run it will output the original size of the picture, the new size of the picture, and save a copy of the new 28x28 pictureImage Resizer:
